# Algorithms written in the Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL)

This is a repo where I keep my little programs I've done in the SPL.

## Bubble sort

### How to use it?

Write 5 numbers that you would like to sort. Do not type any spaces between them!
The program will print the sorted array of numbers. It will neither print a newline character
nor spaces between the numbers. A number must consist of one digit only.

#### Example:
##### In:
```
57490
```
##### Out:
```
04579
```

## Stack sort

### How to use it?

You can enter as much of nonnegative numbers as you want.
Separate the numbers using a newline character. The program will stop getting the
numbers from the input stream when the number "-1" is entered.

#### Example:
##### In:
```
420
404
23
14
290595
1
-1
```
##### Out:
```
1
14
23
404
420
290595
```

## How to compile it?

The Shakespeare Programming Language is usually translated
to C and then compiled. The official translator can be downloaded
from [the official webpage][2].

If you have any difficulties with making the translator run I do recommend
to search thourgh the [Shakespeare Programming Language Tag][1] on StackOverflow.
